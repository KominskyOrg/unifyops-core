# Project Structure Migration Notes

This document summarizes the changes made to move from the previous `backend` directory structure to the new root-level application structure.

## Changes Made

1. **File Relocation**:

   - Moved all contents from `backend/app` to `app/` in the root directory
   - Moved configuration files (.env, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, etc.) to the root
   - Updated README.md to reflect the new structure
   - Created scripts/README.md with documentation for the utility scripts

2. **Path Updates**:

   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow paths in `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`
   - Updated build_and_deploy.sh script to work with the new file locations
   - Created a new dev.sh script in the root scripts directory
   - Updated all relative paths in documentation

3. **Naming Conventions**:

   - Renamed some components from "backend" to "api" for consistency
   - Updated Docker container names in deployment scripts

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the main README.md with the new project structure
   - Created dedicated README for scripts directory

## New Project Structure

```

│   ├── core/            # Core functionality and configuration
│   ├── db/              # Database models and connections
│   ├── models/          # Database models

```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test the Deployment Process**:

   - Verify that the GitHub Actions workflow runs correctly with the new structure
   - Test the deployment scripts manually if needed

2. **Clean Up**:

   - Once everything is working correctly, the old `backend` directory can be removed
   - It's currently added to .gitignore to avoid confusion

3. **Update Documentation**:

   - Review and update any additional documentation that might reference the old structure
   - Update any internal references to the project structure

4. **Developer Notification**:
   - Inform all team members about the structural changes
   - Provide guidance on updating their local development environments
